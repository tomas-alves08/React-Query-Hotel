# React + TypeScript + React Query + Vite

This repository contains the code base for my React, TypeScript and React Query studies and if you want to check the application live you can click on the link below:

There is a demo button on the login form for you to check it out without having an user account.

And once logged in, you can click on the "Upload All" button on the sidebar and refresh the page. This will allow you to see the application with up to date data.
